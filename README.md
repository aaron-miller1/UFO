# UFO SIGHTINGS 

#### Overview
This project is meant to display a data sheet of UFO sightings across the country in 2010, giving the user the information and the ability to filter through this list in various forms in order to better find the unidentified object they are looking for.

#### Results
In order to better find what you are looking for, multiple search criteria have been provided to the left of the data to narrow down your list.

These items inclue, Date, Country, City, State, and Object Shape. To filter through these items enter the appropriate data into a field and hit enter and the list will auto update with your results once you complete. However, be aware that these must be exact matches to what is in the list, including capitalization or lack thereof. So it would be recommended to take a quick clance at the list to see how it is formatted before narrowing your search with filters.

If done correctly the list should be lessened based on the filters.


### Summary
One drawback of this design is the fact that capitalization is a factor in whether or not you see your desired information in the filtered list since depending on how large the list is you may not be able to find out the exact spelling of a world or if the country is upper or lower case. This would also be a recommendation for further development as you could have the code take the input and the data and capitalize everything to receive exact matches upon searching.
